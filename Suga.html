For BTS' third Korean-language extended play (EP) The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 1, Suga released a solo intro entitled "Intro: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life".
The rap track's lyrics itself discussed the fears of reaching adulthood at the end of one's adolescent years.
It released on April 17, 2015, and featured an animated music video.
Pt. 1's follow up EP, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 2, featured another intro performed by Suga, called "Intro: Never Mind", specifically recounting Suga's teenage years.
The song released on November 15, 2015,and additionally served as the intro for BTS' 2016 compilation album The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever.
Suga did not perform another introductory track for BTS until 2020, where he released "Interlude: Shadow" as part of the album roll out for Map of the Soul: 7.
The interlude is a rap song that references "Intro: O!RUL8,2?" from the 2013 EP of the same name, and discusses BTS' fame, comparing its reality to the celebrity O!RUL8,2? dreamed about.
The song released on January 10, along with a music video also referencing the struggles of fame.
Tamar Herman of Billboard described it as a "evocative, yet brash track" and noted how the song's sound changes midway through to show "this dichotomy between the relationship of how fame and audiences watching him affects his idea of self".
In addition to performing intros for BTS, Suga released two solo tracks under the group's name. 
The first, a song entitled "First Love", appeared on BTS' 2016 studio album Wings, is an autobiographical rap track reminiscent of a monologue.
